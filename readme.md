# Calculator Project

This project is a simple calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo with an intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly design with a clean and simple layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: For calculator logic and operations.

# How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the calculator and perform your operations.


## Purpose and Learning Outcomes

The purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding of JavaScript by implementing various logical operations and functions. Through building this calculator, I learned how to:

- **Create and manage functions** to handle different arithmetic operations.
- **Implement event listeners** for button interactions and user input.
- **Use conditionals and loops** to control logic flow.
- **Manipulate the DOM** to display results dynamically.
- **Debug and optimize JavaScript code** to ensure smooth functionality.

This project has enhanced my JavaScript skills, particularly in working with functions, logic handling, and UI interactivity.
